            Hi Shreyada, I know that letters are old-fashioned, but I don't have another option. I don't have
           guts to say it face to face. I know what I say may be slightly unnerving, maybe slightly out of 
           the blue, but I have to say that otherwise I'll regret it. I just want to confess that

           Shreyada I like you, and I love you...‚ù§

           and I had written a little poetry for you.

           "You are the hope in my lonely days,
           A dream I hold in endless ways.
           You are the sunshine that warms my soul,
           the missing piece of my puzzle that makes me whole"

           I know that you are busy with studies right now. I don't need a quick answer. So just tell me whenever.
           You want to tell me what you feel for me. Just direct message me on Instagram at 
           @theguywholostgirl I will wait for your messages.
           Did you know why I chose to type a letter to you? Because I have enough time to tell you after the 6th of
           February I will not be there for you; after that, I am going to Pune for a job, and you also don't
           have enough time. but I don't want to lose you. That's why I choose to type a letter for you.
           I have just one wish: what I have said in this letter I want to confess that
           face to face. Will you complete my just little wish? Just tell me the date, time, and place.
           I will be there waiting for you. At last, focus on your studies and just tell me what you
           feel for me. But please don't ignore it, please. and take care, darling, my love... ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
